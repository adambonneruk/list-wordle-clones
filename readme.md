| [ABSURDLE](https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html) | This is an adversarial version of Josh Wardle's excellent Wordle. "Adversarial" means that Absurdle is actively trying to avoid giving you the answer. With each guess, Absurdle reveals as little information as possible, changing the secret word if need be. Other than that, the rules are the same as Wordle's, except you have unlimited guesses. You'll need them! The best possible score in Absurdle is 4 guesses. |
